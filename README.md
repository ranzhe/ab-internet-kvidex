Fixed version of Kvidex provider for AnyBalance
It's all because of i'm too lazy to set up svn and stuff

##### Installation #####

Just clone and compress files into single .zip-archive and put in /sdcard/AnyBalance on your android device. Then start AnyBalance and install new version of provider via "Providers -> From file" menu. Enjoy!
